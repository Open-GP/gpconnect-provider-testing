Feature: FHIR

Scenario: Retrieve the care record for a patient
	Given I am using the gpconnect FHIR demonstator
		And I am performing the "urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:operation:gpc.getcarerecord" interaction
		And I author a request for the "SUM" care record section for patient with NHS Number "900 000 0033"
	When I request the FHIR "gpc.getcarerecord" Patient Type operation
	Then the response status code should indicate success
		And the response body should be FHIR JSON
		And the JSON value "resourceType" should be "Bundle"
